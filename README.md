# Anarchy Buddy

This is a Discord bot created with anarchy Realms specifically in mind. In particular, it was created for a Bedrock Realm and as such has no functionality for connecting to Minecraft servers on Java (or much interactivity with the Realm itself in any way).

It was partially made following this tutorial (thank you!): https://sydney-sisco.medium.com/build-and-host-your-first-discord-bot-using-node-js-and-aws-20607585b6e3

## What is the purpose?

Think of this like an enhancement of the Discord experience. The idea is that it can be used by players to enhance their gameplay experience and bring some unity and chaos into the realm!

## How to Use

The bot can be started locally by running "npm run build-dev-watch" from the command line while you are in the root directory. All that does is build and then watch for any changes and auto-compile them. From there, you can open another terminal window and run "npm run start-dev" to start the bot.

## Contributing

Please use pull requests and the typical Github workflow while contributing.

## Can I fork this and modify it for my server/Realm?

Absolutely! As you can see from the .code-workspace file, I use VSCode personally to interact with the project. I have a list of recommended extensions below!
